# Face Analytics
A facial recognition web application that can detect a face's emotions, race, and other features.

This application uses the Kairos API to demonstrate a computer's capability of recognizing facial features.

To use this, you need to obtain API credentials from Kairos (https://www.kairos.com) and input them when the application initializes.
